Part E: Analytical Task
Analyze the time complexity of the following stack operations:
• Push
• Pop
• Peek
• Balanced Parentheses Check

✅ Time Complexity Analysis of Stack Operations
1️⃣ Push Operation

Adds an element to the top of the stack.

Takes constant time.

Time Complexity: O(1)

2️⃣ Pop Operation

Removes the top element from the stack.

No shifting of elements required.

Time Complexity: O(1)

3️⃣ Peek Operation

Returns the top element without removing it.

Direct access to top index.

Time Complexity: O(1)

4️⃣ Balanced Parentheses Check

Traverses the entire expression once.

Each character is pushed or popped at most once.

If expression length is n,

Time Complexity: O(n)

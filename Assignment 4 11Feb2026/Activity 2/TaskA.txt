Stack in Function Calls (Call Stack)

When a function is called, its data (variables, return address) is pushed onto the stack.
When it finishes, it is popped.
Since the last function called finishes first, stack follows LIFO.

2️⃣ Stack in Undo/Redo

Each action is pushed onto the Undo stack.
Undo pops the last action.
Redo uses another stack to restore the undone action.

3️⃣ Stack in Expression Evaluation

Stack helps in checking balanced parentheses and evaluating postfix/prefix expressions.
Operands are pushed, and operators pop operands to compute results.
It follows the LIFO rule.

Infix vs Prefix vs Postfix

Infix: A + B (operator in middle)

Prefix: + A B (operator first)

Postfix: A B + (operator last)

Prefix and Postfix do not need parentheses.
